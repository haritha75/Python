the Command Query Separation principle is a valuable guideline for designing and structuring code in a way that promotes clarity, maintainability, and robustness. 
By separating commands and queries, you can make your codebase more predictable, easier to understand, and less error-prone.
using command we can change the state of the systsem
or queries  return answer to the caller without  causes side effects
methods either be command or commands but not both

  Commands are methods or functions that perform an action, modify the state of an object, or cause side effects without returning any value to the caller.

  Queries, on the other hand, are methods or functions that return a result to the caller without causing any side effects or modifying the state of an object.
